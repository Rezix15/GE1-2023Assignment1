# Description of project
A simple cooking game made using the Godot Engine in which users can click on the ingridents (Eggs, Milk, Flour) as they drop into the mixing bowl. Stir the mixing bowl using the whisk to create your batter and pour it into the pan on the next screen to create your pancakes. Points are rewarded for how well you cook your pancakes.

# Instructions for use
Use the left mouse button to click on the ingridients and the click the whisk to make it follow the mouse. Use the right click mouse button to drop the whisk. Use the right key or 'd' key to hover to the next screen  which is the stove section in which when your batter has been completed (noted when the objective is shown above) and also the left and 'a' key to hover back to the baking area. In the stove section, you click the red switch to turn it on. You will know when it has been successfully done, when the hob turns slightly red. Clicking on the pan will drop your pancake batter onto it, where you cook it and wait until the 'Take out' label appears. When clicking on this, the pancake would be taken out of the pan and placed onto the white plate on top of the second hob. Depending on how fast you take out the pancake, you will be awarded points. Failure to get the pancake on time will grant you a burnt pancake which awards 0 points so be careful. Repeat the steps until all 5 pancakes have been made.
